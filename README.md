# Loan Status Prediction App

This is a **Streamlit** app that predicts the loan status (Approved or Rejected) based on user input data. The app uses Machine Learning model called **XGBoost** for making predictions based on various factors like age, income, loan amount, and more.

## How it Works

1. **Enter Data**: The user provides personal information like age, income, loan amount, etc.
2. **Model Processing**: The app processes the input and uses a pre-trained **XGBoost** model to predict the loan status.
3. **Prediction Results**: The app returns whether the loan will be **Approved** or **Rejected**.
